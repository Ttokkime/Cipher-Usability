# Cipher Usability
This program will either encrypt or decrypt a message depending on the mode, key, and message inputted by the user. The modes being encrypt or decrypt and the key, which is used in the Ceasar cipher, being a number that represents the how much the letters' positions shifts in a message. 

### Project
My project:
- Imports the string library to access more characters.
- Shares an opening message with the user that describes what the program will do.
- Gets the user input (capital letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and keyboard symbols), the key, and the mode (encrypt or decrypt).
- Gives back the encrypted or decrypted message
